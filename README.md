# bikesharing

## Overview

This analysis is about brining a similar concept of Citi Bike (bike sharing company) to a hometown of a fictional caracter, Kate. Thoughout this analysis, I utilized tools such as python with the libary Pandas as well as Tableau Public to transform data and create visualizations for an angel investor. Tableau is a very powerful tool for visualization, but it lacks the backend capabilities of transforming data such as python. Used together they are a great combination.
