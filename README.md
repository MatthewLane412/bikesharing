## Overview

This analysis is about brining a similar concept of Citi Bike (bike sharing company) to a hometown of a fictional caracter, Kate. Thoughout this analysis, I utilized tools such as python with the libary Pandas as well as Tableau Public to transform data and create visualizations for an angel investor. Tableau is a very powerful tool for visualization, but it lacks the backend capabilities of transforming data such as python. Used together they are a great combination.

Most bikes stop usage around 8-9am in the morning and 5-7pm at night. Baesd on this, there is a good probablity many bike users utilize bike sharing to commute to and from work.
