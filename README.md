## Overview

This analysis is about bringing a similar concept of Citi Bike (bike sharing company) to a hometown of a fictional character, Kate. Throughout this analysis, I utilized tools such as python with the library Pandas as well as Tableau Public to transform data and create visualizations for an angel investor. Tableau is a very powerful tool for visualization, but it lacks the backend capabilities of transforming data such as python. Used together they are a great combination.

Most bike sharing users are subscribers and utilize the bikes on weekdays.

Most bikes are used at 5:00pm and 6:00pm

Starting and ending locations are heavily in the same areas. This will help with auto redistribution of the bikes.

Most bikes stop usage around 8-9am in the morning and 5-7pm at night. Based on this, there is a good probability many bike users utilize bike sharing to commute to and from work.

Start and End times are similar for both genders. Males use ride sharing more in this analysis.

## Summary

Based on all the results males are more likely to use bike sharing. Weekdays during the day are the most popular times. Most rides are for less than 1 hour (many of which are only ~10 minutes). Due to the short length of rides, may of the bike end up close to the starting point. If many people use them to get to and from work, the bikes are brough back to the same starting point each day. 

A couple more analysis that could be performed is starting time for most rides (expected to be slightly earlier than end times) and the ages of riders.
